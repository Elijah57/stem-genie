## STEM Bot

STEM Bot is a Telegram bot designed to help users with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. The bot provides information on various STEM topics, such as programming, robotics, engineering concepts, and more. It aims to support learners by answering their questions and providing clear explanations for different STEM subjects.

## Features

**STEM Topic Definitions**: Enter any STEM-related term, and get a detailed explanation, including its significance, applications, and related concepts.

**Robotics Assistance**: If the term refers to robotics, the bot will provide useful insights into components, mechanisms, and their applications in real-world projects.

**Programming Help**: The bot can assist with basic to advanced programming queries, code examples, and algorithm explanations.

**Engineering Concepts**: Get clear, concise explanations of fundamental engineering principles, tools, and technologies.

**Educational Support**: Aimed at helping students learn STEM concepts in a fun and interactive way.

### Usage

To use the bot, start a conversation with the **STEM Bot** on Telegram.

1. Open the bot and type a STEM term or question.
2. The bot will respond with an explanation, including relevant examples, definitions, and use cases.

Example

(bot) Welcome! Type any STEM term or question, and I’ll provide an explanation.  
(user) What is Ohm’s Law?  
(bot) **Ohm’s Law**  
**Definition**: Ohm's Law states that the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance.  
**Formula**: \( I = \frac{V}{R} \)  
**Where**:  
- \( I \) is the current (in amperes),  
- \( V \) is the voltage (in volts),  
- \( R \) is the resistance (in ohms).  
**Application**: Ohm’s Law is used to calculate the amount of current, voltage, or resistance in a circuit.
